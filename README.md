# GTFS for Estimating Transit Ridership and Supporting Multimodal Performance Measures

This repository contains the code that the U.S. DOT Volpe Center and Office of the Undersecretary for Policy developed for their proof-of-concept project exploring how General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) schedule data could be used to estimate road segment-level transit ridership and support multimodal performance measures.

## Getting involved
This public-domain code was developed as part of a proof-of-concept project, and we encourage transit agencies, state DOTs, or other interested parties to consider how these tools to estimate ridership and calculate multimodal performance measures might be useful to them. We also welcome contributions back into this repoistory as a building block for peers. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
